## MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

### MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag

### Possible Extensions:

- CRUD actions for the transactions
- Show a warning when the total expenditure is over budget (set a hard coded budget first)
- Add a date to the transactions and view total spending by month
- Any other ideas you might come up with
